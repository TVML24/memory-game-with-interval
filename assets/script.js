// variables for each card

// random number generator for each card that sets the data attribute for each card variable when start is pressed
//BUT ensures that there MUST be at least 2 card variables with matching values
//data-state on the cards changes to hidden

// a timer starts counting down from thirty seconds

// When event listener hears a click on a card

// the data-state changes from hidden to visible displaying the stored variable made by the random number generator

//this variable is then stored in a new variable

//when the second card is clicked it compares the variable from the first card to the second card

//if they match both cards change background colour so that they are no longer visible

//if timer reaches zero before the player has won the game header displays "You Lose" and playerLoss++

//if all the cards are now the background colour header displays "You Win" and playerWin++

//clear function activates at the end to return cards to their original state

//write score function writes the score in a text area in the footer
